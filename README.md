The purpose of this project â€‹was to apply all the concepts that I learnt during my programming course. The main focus was on the basic principles of a game like Collision detection, Sprites, animations, camera etc. At the same time, I had to apply and extend all my knowledge of object-oriented programming and C++, including aspects like templates, Interfaces, polymorphism, Standard library sequences and containers.
